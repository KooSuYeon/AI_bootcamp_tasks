However, MISO Information Technology, led by CEO An Dong-Uk, took a different path. They embarked on a journey rooted in big data - a field seemingly unrelated to healthcare and have now reached the forefront of global AI-driven healthcare. Celebrating its 17th year since its founding, MISO Information Technology has always centered its growth around data-driven operations. CEO An initiated the business by focusing on medical data platforms with the concept of handling hospital data. He expressed, \"We began by dealing with hospital data, aiming to establish a comprehensive medical data platform.\" He proudly stated, \"Our Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW) has become the most widely used platform in the nation.\" Extensive handling of hospital data naturally led to solving conventional data challenges. They addressed both structured and unstructured data, managing data sizes and operational complexities. From this foundation emerged the 'smart BIG,' a platform designed to suit medical environments. Unlike traditional CDWs that analyze structured data such as EMR (Electronic Medical Records) and CT scans, the introduction of AI has emphasized the importance of both structured and unstructured data in the learning process. Unstructured textual data, like chart records and diagnostic reports, comprise a staggering 80% of hospital data. However, until now, managing structured and unstructured data separately resulted in decreased operational efficiency. CEO An stressed, \"Among the platforms available, MISO Information Technology is the only one capable of handling both structured and unstructured data.\" 'Smart BIG' integrates an all-in-one Enterprise MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) solution that facilitates AI development without coding, creating a medical alliance platform. It combines closed-cloud-based AI training data collection, preprocessing, and processing within hospitals, along with big data analysis. This integration supports clinical research analysis through the Smart Clinical Data Research System (smart CDRS). From AI development to training and deployment of the latest deep learning models, and even AI inference services, all become possible with a single click. Many existing medical AI solutions focus on analyzing CT and MRI images. When combined with Smart BIG, these solutions become significantly more efficient. In essence, Smart BIG can serve as a 'portal' for medical data processing, a strategic focus for business expansion, especially given the scarcity of platforms like Smart BIG in the global market. Smart BIG is set to be implemented at Incheon Sejong Hospital by year-end, and discussions are underway with several other hospitals. The expansion isn't limited to healthcare; the need for integrated platforms for structured and unstructured data extends beyond medical institutions. Secure closed-cloud environments preferred by businesses due to security reasons are applicable to various industries. Recent ventures into aerospace and energy sectors showcase this versatility. Building on this growth trajectory, MISO Information Technology announced a target of 100 billion KRW in revenue by 2025 during a press conference last June. The expansion of 'Smart TA' significantly contributes to this target. Smart TA complements Smart BIG by converting unstructured data into structured formats. It's an AI-based automated text categorization solution that processes and classifies various unstructured text data and documents from hospitals, medical institutions, and companies. This transformation contributes not only to data assetization but also plays a crucial role in extracting insights. MISO Information Technology has opened a dedicated R&D center to support its rising growth. Last month, they inaugurated the 'Healthcare R&D Center' in Daejeon International Science Business Belt Sin-dong Zone, focusing on the development of cutting-edge healthcare technology, AI healthcare data construction, and analysis. These strategies aim to expand within the healthcare market and achieve global expansion.  The company is also embarking on unique challenges, venturing into the metaverse field with the development of a 'Metaverse Interview' and a 'Metaverse Treasure Hunt Game.' CEO An explained, \"Even before the term 'metaverse' existed, MISO Information Technology aimed to establish a gateway to collect new forms of data.\" He emphasized a pragmatic approach, focusing on business relevance and profitability. He described the value of the metaverse interview as an effective tool for assessing character and authenticity through spontaneous situations and game elements. They're also developing an augmented reality (AR) service called the treasure hunt service in the vein of 'Pokémon GO.' However, CEO An clarified that their focus lies in creating an expansive narrative around concealing treasures rather than finding them. He pointed out that the scope of the story would depend on whom they involve in the search, thereby potentially becoming a universally accessible service for both enterprises and individuals. In this manner, designing a connected structure that bridges virtual and real, and links business revenue and profit structures, is at the core of the metaverse venture. Above all, CEO An has found strength in the term 'software company.' \"Korean IT industries have gained significant recognition in the global market, and their technological prowess is widely acknowledged. However, the term 'K-Software' has not become as prevalent as K-pop or K-food,\" he remarked. He expressed his aspiration, stating, \"MISO Information Technology's goal is to become a truly global K-Software company.\" By Lee Ju-Young 이주영 기자 juyoung09@aitimes.com"
