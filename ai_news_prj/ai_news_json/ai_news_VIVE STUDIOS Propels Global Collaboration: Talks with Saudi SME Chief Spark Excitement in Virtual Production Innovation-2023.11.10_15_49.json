The visit materialized through the Technology Guarantee Fund, which recommended VIVE STUDIOS as a promising domestic enterprise. Notably, VIVE STUDIOS attained the highest AA rating in the June technical evaluation, making it the first company in the virtual production sector to be selected for 'preliminary unicorn' by the Ministry of SMEs and Startups The delegation from Saudi Arabia’s SME Authority expressed keen interest in AI-based virtual production and virtual human creation technologies, including VIT and VIPLE. They particularly inquired about the feasibility of establishing virtual studio facilities locally and sought insights into the utilization of VIT, a local business's integrated virtual production solution. VIVE STUDIOS has been actively engaged in discussions following its participation in a Middle East economic envoy last month. During the visit to Saudi Arabia’s Neom City, discussions included on-site inspections and detailed proposals for collaboration in the Neom project.

Kim Se-gyu, CEO of VIVE STUDIOS, affirmed, \"The distinctive technological prowess and business competitiveness of VIVE STUDIOS in virtual production technologies and solutions have already been proven through the advanced evaluation system, resulting in our selection for preliminary Unicorn. Leveraging this visit from the Saudi Small and Medium Enterprises Authority, we aim to swiftly explore avenues for local projects, including the Neom project, and dedicate our efforts to securing new growth opportunities through international expansion.\" By Ju Young Lee juyoung09@aitimes.com"
