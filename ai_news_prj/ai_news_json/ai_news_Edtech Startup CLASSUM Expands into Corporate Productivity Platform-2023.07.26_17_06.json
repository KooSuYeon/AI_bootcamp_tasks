Building upon its success as an education platform, CLASSUM is set to evolve into a comprehensive corporate productivity powerhouse. The platform's astounding growth trajectory has been nothing short of remarkable. In just 18 months, the number of university lectures delivered through CLASSUM's proprietary solution has soared by a staggering 422%. Moreover, compared to January 2022, the platform has witnessed an over 330% increase in postings and a remarkable 410% surge in interactions, amassing an impressive repository of over 800,000 contributions. CEO Lee Chae-rin disclosed that \"while CLASSUM was traditionally utilized as a communication tool or integrated into Learning Management Systems (LMS) with a communication-centric focus, the recent trend has seen its integration as a Knowledge Management System (KMS) in corporate environments.\" The company's cutting-edge AI Dot 2.0 technology aims to enhance productivity, making it equally valuable for educational institutions as well as businesses. Often dubbed as the 'Kakaotalk (or Slack) of the Education World,' CLASSUM offers a specialized communication platform tailored to the unique needs of the education sector. Unlike businesses that commonly utilize platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams, the education world relies heavily on email and messenger services. However, this reliance poses challenges, hindering effective communication, efficiency, and the utilization of accumulated data. To address these obstacles, CLASSUM has introduced features such as selective anonymity, an intuitive SNS-style user interface (UI), and collaborative challenge functionalities. These innovative elements facilitate successful knowledge exchange and foster seamless communication through the strategic incorporation of live sessions, video-on-demand(VOD), quizzes, surveys, and flexible course design, which have resulted in an impressive influx of over 300 questions and answers within just four months of a single educational course. CLASSUM has taken things a step further by integrating the 'AI Dot,' an automated response system that draws upon internal data rather than relying solely on internet-based data like other AI solutions. This unique approach offers users the ability to trust and utilize responses backed by verifiable sources. Beyond real-time communication, CLASSUM also offers a comprehensive dashboard that displays accumulated communication data. This valuable resource allows for in-depth analyses of individual educational courses, employee activity trends, and the identification of trending topics—transforming CLASSUM into a hub for sharing knowledge and expertise. Undeniably, CLASSUM's value extends beyond the confines of the education sector. Not only does it empower educational organizations and mentoring initiatives, but it also offers businesses the means to perpetually share knowledge and know-how, driving tangible results. Looking ahead, CEO Lee Chae-rin foresees the substantial impact of AI-based work environments on corporate productivity. As data becomes increasingly crucial, she believes that breaking down employees' \"psychological barriers\" to data sharing, knowledge exchange, and questioning is essential to amassing essential data. For corporations, utilizing CLASSUM's AI Dot optimizes responses to repetitive questions and reduces the time spent on information searches, allowing employees to focus on core tasks. As the question-and-answer data accumulates, AI Dot's ability to address inquiries improves, freeing up valuable time spent on repetitive question responses. \"By incorporating CLASSUM's AI Dot, enterprises can reduce response times to repetitive questions and information searches, freeing up invaluable time for employees to focus on core tasks. As the AI accumulates data from question-and-answer interactions, its ability to address inquiries grows exponentially, enabling employees to invest more time in essential responsibilities,\" said Lee Chae-rin, the CEO. Additionally, AI Dot streamlines information searches during work tasks. While employees previously struggled to locate necessary files within individual folders, AI Dot now fetches the relevant information in response to employee questions, saving valuable time spent on information searches. CLASSUM's exponential success has garnered significant attention both locally and globally. Corporations such as Samsung, LG, DB Group, and institutions including Seoul National University, KAIST, and Yonsei University, among others in 32 countries worldwide, have embraced and incorporated CLASSUM into their daily operations. As a testament to its accomplishments, CLASSUM's revenue has tripled compared to the previous year, reaching impressive heights in the first quarter of this year, nearly matching its entire annual revenue from the previous year. Its influence has expanded even further, with a growing presence in the United States, propelling CLASSUM into new territories and inspiring further international expansion. \"Our core mission is to foster an environment of sharing knowledge, facilitating open dialogue, and encouraging collective growth.\" By transcending traditional educational technology, CLASSUM is setting its sights on becoming a 'Growth Tech' powerhouse, catering not only to the educational sector but also to the diverse needs of corporations and individuals seeking constant growth and development. With the promise of breaking down barriers to knowledge sharing, 'CLASSUM is poised to redefine the way institutions and businesses communicate, collaborate, and flourish in the dynamic landscape of the digital era. As the platform continues to chart an ambitious path forward, its influence promises to leave an indelible mark on both the world of education and corporate productivity.
