Prominent companies in the field of digital twin and metaverse-related businesses, including Nokia, Optofidelity, Basemark, Immersal, and Visual Components, took the lead. These Finnish companies, gathered at the Finland Pavilion, showcased their latest technologies and expressed their desire for collaboration, stating that \"Korea is an important technology market and partner.\" They expressed their intention to foster extensive collaboration through this opportunity. Nokia introduced three solutions at the event, leveraging their accumulated expertise of over 30 years in communication, multimedia, and IoT domains. These solutions include a 5G dedicated network solution applicable even to factories, cost-effective 'Optical LAN' solutions, and data center fabric solutions that offer openness and automation for data center networking. Philippe Gerard, the Chief Manufacturing Officer of Nokia, emphasized the importance of AI, which is the core focus of this event. He stated, \"To realize AI, an ecosystem, particularly a connected ecosystem, is crucial. Without connectivity or flexibility, AI applications cannot function.\" He further explained that the key technology being introduced is the next-generation data center fabric. He emphasized the need for significant connectivity in large-scale data centers that power AI algorithms and big data, enabling systems to communicate with each other and engage with users. He stated, \"We provide data center fabric, which offers extremely fast interfaces. Next-generation interfaces are already surpassing 10Gb (gigabytes) per second, going up to 25Gb, 100Gb, 400Gb, and 800Gb.\" Moreover, he mentioned that programmers desire flexibility as they may not know which parts of the network or machinery need to communicate with each other. He introduced the concept of \"programmability\" and \"programmable networks,\" highlighting that designers no longer need to worry about network constraints. This enables faster and more flexible deployment of AI services. Gerard also emphasized the importance of the Korean market. He stated, \"As a global technology leader, I believe that Korea embodies a great deal of innovation. Looking at the field of robotics alone, AI and metaverse are undoubtedly crucial topics.\" He added, \"We have collaborated with many Korean companies and have witnessed their significant international expansion. Nokia wants to be part of the Korean ecosystem, and that's why we are delighted to participate in this event.\" Optofidelity specializes in AR, VR, and XR. They showcased their flagship product called 'Buddy,' which allows testing the response time and performance of virtual reality devices. Optofidelity’s Buddy is a leading comprehensive measurement system for HMDs in VR, AR, and MR applications. Optofidelity also addressed the technical challenges of mass-producing AR smart glasses during the conference. Pekka Laiho, the Chief Business Officer of Optofidelity, opened up the discussion by mentioning Apple's recent release of the 'Vision Pro' headset. He stated, \"Apple's launch of the Vision Pro headset is like a blessing to the virtual reality headset market.\" He explained that releasing prototypes of headsets is not easy due to the enormous production costs and the challenge of generating revenue. Therefore, it is crucial for big tech companies like Apple to make the initial move, as it is expected to lead to rapid growth in the VR and headset market. However, he emphasized that even large corporations like Apple face limitations in solving issues such as motion sickness solely through hardware or manufacturing technology. In this regard, companies like Optofidelity play a significant role in overcoming such challenges. Furthermore, he expressed his hope, stating, \"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been three years since I visited Korea. Through this event, I hope to meet many companies and engage in fruitful business meetings.\" Basemark is a software and service company specializing in AR, HMI graphics, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) solutions for vehicles equipped with next-generation software. They have established partnerships with numerous automobile manufacturers in the United States and Europe and are actively pursuing expansion in the Asian market, particularly targeting automotive manufacturing in Korea, Japan, and China. Tero Sarkkinen, the CEO of Basemark, expressed his excitement about visiting Korea, a country that is home to world-leading automotive manufacturers, for the first time through this event. He mentioned that he is currently conducting business meetings with various companies and hopes for successful business discussions with Korean companies during this event. He also delivered a speech as a speaker in relevant sessions, presenting AR-related technologies under the theme of \"Enhancing Driving Safety and Comfort through Augmented Reality.\" Immersal, specializing in visual positioning, spatial mapping, and AR, participated in this event with the theme of \"Creating New City Experiences.\" Sam Poole, the Sales Director of Immersal, highlighted that market research is the primary objective of their participation. He stated, \"Many companies are already using Immersal's services. We possess services that enable augmented reality, and it is valuable to have the opportunity to engage with various content companies that have ideas they want to materialize. Through this, I hope to explore the ideas related to the metaverse and understand the trends in the Korean metaverse market.\" Visual Components showcased their expertise in manufacturing-specific digital twin and smart factory technologies. Established in 1999, they have grown as a global leader in the field of 3D simulation. They also covered the topic of \"Digital Twin and Smart Factory\" in a conference session. Park Soo-jin, the representative of Visual Components in Korea, enthusiastically shared her thoughts on participating in the event, emphasizing the exciting opportunities for collaboration with potential partners. She stated, \"By taking part in this event, I have identified several promising partners for future collaborations with Visual Components.\" Additionally, she expressed her satisfaction with the networking opportunities the event provided, particularly with representatives from Finnish companies such as Nokia, and the chance to connect with numerous Korean clients in attendance. by Ju young Lee juyoung09@aitimes.com"
