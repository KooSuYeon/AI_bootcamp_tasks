Just as Disney Research provides the technological innovation behind Disney's dazzling visuals, VIVE STUDIOS envisions VIV LAB playing a similar role.\" VIVE STUDIOS CTO Lee Kwang-hee unveiled his plans to transform VIV LAB into a technological powerhouse comparable to Disney Research. He emphasized that VIVE STUDIOS, with its array of creators, planners, directors, and IPs like the beloved ‘JZ’, is positioned similarly to Disney Studios. Just as Disney Research contributes cutting-edge technology behind the captivating visuals of Disney films, VIV LAB will take up a parallel role in VIVE STUDIOS. VIVE STUDIOS, a virtual production specialist founded by CEO Kim Se-kyu in 2003, initially started as a video content production company before expanding into advertising, game cinematic videos, and more. In 2017, it ventured into the realm of virtual reality(VR) content and released the VR film 'VOLT: CHAIN CITY’ garnering accolades at prestigious film festivals in the US and receiving invitations to the Sundance Film Festival. To integrate visual AI and extended reality(XR) technologies into its content production pipeline, VIVE STUDIOS launched the AI research lab ‘VIV LAB’ in January 2022. Having begun his career at Samsung Medical, Lee, the current chief of VIV LAB, has focused on expanding computer vision and AI across various domains. He progressed from leading the image generation team at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (AIRI) of Samsung Medical to the AI technology lead at Boeing Korea Research and Technology Center before joining VIVE STUDIOS as the CTO in December 2021. He pinpointed two core aspects of VIV LAB: virtual production solutions and virtual human technology. Virtual production involves using an \"LED wall\" panel as a backdrop for shooting, replacing the traditional green screen method, and enabling real-time visualization and modification of scenes using the Unreal Engine. Lee explained that this approach maximizes workflow efficiency by allowing immediate review and decision-making for scenes requiring collaboration and adjustments during production. He noted that VIVE STUDIOS was the first to implement this technique in Korea. The technology to implement this concept is called ‘VIT,’ which integrates and controls key elements like LED displays, camera tracking, and real-time engines, applicable to various content forms such as movies, music videos, and live performances. VIVE STUDIOS had already employed VIT for collaborations, including a 2022 partnership with HIBE for original story video content and involvement in the production of the TXT music video under Big Hit Music, and the KBS documentary 'Kiss the Universe' in 2021. An upcoming B2B solution release in October is planned, marking what Lee describes as the debut of VIT beyond internal content creation. Regarding the Virtual Human business, he emphasized the importance of IPs alongside technology. \"Disney and Marvel's influence stems largely from their robust fan bases built around their unique IPs\" he explained. This strategy drove VIVE STUDIOS to secure 21 proprietary IPs, including 'Volt,' which shook global VR film festivals a few years ago, and the recent virtual human project 'JZ' introduced last year. 'JZ' debuted with a spectacular performance at the end of last year at the Melon Music Awards and has expanded its activities through platforms like Instagram. Lee shared his outlook for the future, stating, \"In 10 or 20 years, humanoid robots resembling humans are expected to play various roles in our daily lives.\" He predicted, \"The key technology enabling humanoid robots will be virtual human technology.\" He stressed the implementation of three different techniques for creating virtual humans: 3D modeling, 2D AI face swapping, and 2D AI cloning. \"Different techniques are suitable for different domains,\" he explained. \"We aim to enhance the completeness of virtual humans through an organic blend of technologies.\" Looking ahead, VIVE STUDIOS plans to integrate language models like ChatGPT to enable real-time conversations. Rather than relying on large language models from big tech companies, they initiated the development of their own small-scale language models. Lee clarified, \"The idea is to have a role-specific function. Traditional large language models are too massive and expensive to maintain. This approach also aims to offer a business solution for companies seeking to adopt visual chatbots.\" While many companies are currently focusing on 'conversational virtual humans,' VIV Lab takes a different approach. \"Rather than solely fixating on one aspect, we are preparing for the future within the essence of video content creation\", Lee stated. Their strategy involves immediate business utilization while also preparing for the upcoming metaverse market. VIVE STUDIOS is presently co-producing the KBS 50th-anniversary special project historical drama 'Goryeo-Khitan War,' where they are applying VIV Lab’s technology. In contrast to other tech companies that develop technology first and then seek applications, VIV LAB develops technology aligned with existing domains. Lee emphasized this as VIV Lab's unique proposition. Ultimately, VIV LAB's goal is to incessantly explore content creation and technology, evolving into a premier global production technology research institute. \"I have been engaged in AI for a considerable time, yet there have been numerous occasions where a specific domain was absent. Possessing technology alone doesn't yield substantial outcomes. From that perspective, there have been significant challenges,\" he remarked. \"On the other hand, my goal is to create an impressive research lab like Disney Research, equipped with both IP and technology,\" he emphasized. \"At VIVE STUDIOS, we embody the utmost ideal company structure - a clear domain harmonizing seamlessly with AI technology, facilitating collaboration between domain experts and AI engineers.\" By Ju Young Lee (juyoung09@aitimes.com)"
