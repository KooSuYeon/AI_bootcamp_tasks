    "content": "Gaudiolab, an AI-based audio specialist, announced its intention to expand its main business by showcasing its expertise in the field of Foley Sound at a global event. Chon Sang-bae, the CSO of Gaudiolab, stated on the 30th, \"The company, which has received numerous accolades in the field of sound, is now focusing on sound generation AI, specifically Foley Sound.\" Foley Sound, named after Jack Foley, who was in charge of sound in Hollywood during the 1940s and 1950s, involves creating sounds such as footsteps, horse hoofbeats, barking dogs, and sword fighting sounds in movies. Gaudiolab participated as the main organizer in the Foley sound synthesis category of the AI sound generation challenge held at the DCASE (Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events) event hosted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in the United States last month. They also competed and achieved second place globally. However, what is more important than winning a place is the fact that this field emerged through Gaudiolab's proposal, indicating the significant influence they hold in this domain. Sound generation AI generates sounds using text prompts, similar to image generation AI. The underlying principle follows the diffusion method used by image generation AI, refining meaningful signals from white noise. Chon Sang-bae, the CSO, explained, \"We have been conducting research on sound generation AI long before the introduction of ChatGPT in 2021.\" He further mentioned, \"Through dedicated and ongoing research, we achieved our first successful sound generation in June 2022, and have since progressed to the stage of generating sound from text and image inputs.\" The ultimate goal is to develop a perfect \"multimodal\" sound generation AI that can generate sound from video inputs. The aim is for the AI to analyze the video and create suitable sounds for each scene, similar to how an engineer selects sounds while watching a movie, becoming the ultimate “endgame” of sound generation AI. It is explained that sound effects work consumes approximately 30% to 80% of the actual movie sound engineering process. Sound engineers spend a significant amount of time searching, listening, and incorporating sounds while watching visuals. Gaudiolab aims to reduce that time. Due to OpenAI's ChatGPT, AI-generated content is becoming more commonplace. Image generation AI such as \"Midjourney\" or \"Stable Diffusion\" needs no introduction, and recently, AI-generated content in the field of voice has also gained prominence through the replication of music by artists Drake and The Weeknd. On the other hand, sound generation is relatively unexplored, and Gaudiolab is leading the way as a global frontrunner in this field. The technologies developed by the company include GSEP (sound source separation), GTS (Gaudiolab Text Sync) for generating lyrics and subtitles, sound generation AI (Foley Sound), binaural rendering essential for immersive metaverse experiences, spatial audio, BTRS (on-site sound recreation system), volume normalization, spatial upmix, and more. Although these technologies may be unfamiliar at first, it can be said that there is no one in Korea who has not heard Gaudiolab's sound. With applications in streaming platforms such as Naver Now and Bugs Music, as well as FLO, Weverse, OTT services, theaters, smartphones, wireless earphones, and more, around 20 million users experience Gaudiolab's technology daily. Chon Sang-bae, the CSO, is the key figure behind the birth of this technology. He is a renowned domestic expert with a Ph.D. in audio engineering from Seoul National University and over 20 years of experience in the field. He previously developed the MPEG-H 3D Audio, a three-dimensional audio standard, at Samsung Electronics' DMC Research Institute (now Samsung Research) and applied it to products such as smartphones, TVs, soundbars, and home theaters. Gaudiolab, founded in 2015, consists of over 40 audio experts, including nine rare audio engineering Ph.D. holders, making it a global leader in the field. The focus of CSO Chon Sang-bae and Gaudiolab on sound generation AI is driven by the tremendous growth potential it holds. He stated, \"Improving productivity in mainstream media industries such as movies, OTT, and games is essential, as well as in terms of creating virtual spaces in metaverse platforms.\" In the metaverse, constant sound generation is required to match actions such as footsteps or picking up objects. However, this task is typically limited to a small number of experts. Foley synthesis technology, on the other hand, enables anyone to easily create sound. Regarding their plans for commercialization, they stated that all possibilities are open. He mentioned, \"There are cases where technology is developed based on market needs, and on the other hand, there are cases where technology is developed first, followed by finding a market. In the case of this technology, it leans more toward the latter.\" He revealed, \"The project itself is highly challenging, so we started with the mindset of seizing the global leading position without considering the market, aiming to accomplish what no one else has been able to do.\" But he was still confident that the technology developed by the company will penetrate the market, based on the fact that they have already done so in the past. He also pointed out that due to the recent K-content boom, the workload in sound production has reached an overwhelming level in Korea, to the point where some tasks need to be outsourced to foreign countries. Therefore, he stated, \"Gaudiolab's Foley Sound Synthesis technology also adds significant value by enhancing their productivity.\" Finally, he emphasized, \"The goal is to create a future where AI generates realistic sounds in all areas that require sound, such as movies and dramas, allowing anyone to easily create and experience the desired sound.\" By Ju Young Lee (juyoung09@aitimes.com)"
