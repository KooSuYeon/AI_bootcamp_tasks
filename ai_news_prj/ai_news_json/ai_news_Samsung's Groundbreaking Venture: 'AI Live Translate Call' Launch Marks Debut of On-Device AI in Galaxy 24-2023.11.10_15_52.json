    "content": "In a pioneering move into the realm of on-device artificial intelligence (AI), Samsung Electronics is set to introduce 'AI Live Translate Call’ in early 2024. In stark contrast to Apple's strategy, which has historically focused on enhancing product features, Samsung appears poised to integrate revolutionary technology that could impact sales. Samsung Electronics, led by CEO Han Jong-hee, announced on its website on the 9th that it would kick off with the 'AI Live Translate Call' technology in early 2024, showcasing the on-device 'Galaxy AI.' The AI Live Translate Call feature supports simultaneous translation without the need for a separate process. Users can simply converse, and the technology provides instant interpretation without the requirement for the other party to use a Samsung smartphone or install a specific app. Translation occurs in real-time as the user speaks, utilizing the Galaxy AI-equipped phone. The translation can be heard audibly or viewed as text on the smartphone screen. Samsung leverages the strength of on-device AI, handling all processes within the device without the need for an internet connection, and addressing concerns related to potential data leaks and security issues. Samsung Electronics plans to expand 'Galaxy AI' to various product lines in the future, emphasizing overcoming language barriers for efficient business operations through both in-house technology and collaborations with industry leaders. Based on this announcement, Qualcomm's recently unveiled smartphone processor, 'Snapdragon 8 Gen3,' is speculated to be a strong contender for Samsung's mobile core chip. This product is known for on-device AI optimization, enabling on-the-fly image generation through stable diffusion of 10 billion parameters in just one second. Choi Won-jun, Head of Development at Samsung Electronics' MX Business Unit, stated, \"Mobile AI technology, now converging with Galaxy, will create new experiences previously unseen, redefining the role of smartphones.\" The real-time translation call feature is expected to debut with the release of the Galaxy 24 in early 2024. Although specific models were not disclosed, the timing aligns with the unveiling of Galaxy AI. Meanwhile, Apple recently introduced its proprietary Large Language Model (LLM) technology, 'Apple GPT,' across its entire product line. At the 'Scary Fast' event on the 30th of last month, Apple showcased the AI-driven 'M3' chip powering the MacBook Pro and iMac PC. However, the iPhone 15, unveiled last month, featured on-device AI enhancement without any specific additional functions. Experts predict that features like 'Siri' equipped with generative AI chatbots, similar to 'ChatGPT,' will likely make their debut early next year. Samsung Electronics also unveiled its internally developed generative AI model, 'Samsung Gauss,' during the 'Samsung AI Forum 2023' held the previous day.
